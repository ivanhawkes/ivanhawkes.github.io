<h2 class="title text-center">About Us</h2>

A few years ago, through unavoidable circumstances, I found myself suddenly and irreversibly time rich and cash poor. This website strives to document my attempts at finding a better way to live when forced into these circumstances.

I am situated on a piece of family land, in the mild sub-tropical climate of South East Queensland, Australia. The ground is steep, and fairly barren of topsoil and plants. It is my intention to slowly transform the land using regenerative agriculture and permaculture.

It promises to be a long journey, but one that will ensure a better future for my nieces. I can't undo or even slow the endless onslaught of consumerism that is destroying this world, but I can make one place a little more tolerable for the next generation.
