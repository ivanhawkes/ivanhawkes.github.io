Every day, I go outside around dusk and call out "chookie chookie chookie" and my three lovely chickens come running towards me, clucking all around my feet. They get another cup full of grain for their bowl, I fill their water bowl, toss in some treats into their coop and lock them up for the night.

In return, they are giving us three beautiful eggs a day. That's enough for us to give away a carton of eggs each week or so which is far better than I expected to receive.

Also, they are prolific shitters, and I'm not too proud to scoop it all up and put it into my compost heap. Thanks girls!
