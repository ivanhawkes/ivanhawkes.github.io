It's been a tough week, but the first planting is completed for the orchard I am starting at the front of our house.

The trees are all still quite small. They have been kept in containers until now and are no doubt keen to spread their roots in the good soil.

The trees are spaced far enough apart for when they are full grown. In between I am placing shrubs and other small plants that I have on hand.

Next week, a large packet of ground cover seed will arrive and I'll broadcast that over the remaining areas to provide a cover crop for green manure. There's flowers and the like in there too, which will make it really look lush in there.

In no particular order we now have:

* Mandarin
* Orange
* Raspberry
* Eureka Lemon
* Kaffir Lime x 2
* Lemonade
* Lady Finger Bananas x 2
* Tamarillo x 2
* Curry Leaf Tree
* Figoa
* Bay Leaf
* Mango
* Comfrey
* Lemongrass
* Chilli
* Capsicum
* Ginger
* Turmeric
* Rosemary

We now have approximately 45m of garden beds, all with deep draining soil and covered in a rich compost created by the bush turkey. It's lightly planted for the moment, but in due course it will be heaving with plants.

I'm sure I'm missing some plants...but I'm tired and now it's time to reward myself with some whiskey and a kebab.
