Remember those pictures I posted of a dirty hole, subsequently filled with logs, sticks, and covered in hay?

This is that hole a few months later, as the plants are starting to come into Spring.

I planted:

* peppers
* chilli
* coriander
* sage
* aubergine
* vietnamese mint
* basil
* silverbeet

There's also a mystery plant whose species I have forgotten. Need to wait till it fruits or is bigger to remember what it was.

Total cost for this bed was:

* a couple of hours of hard digging
* some time with the chainsaw and a tree we had to drop earlier
* one and a half bales of hay - roughly $18 AUD

It's right outside the door, so every time I step out there now, instead of a dead pile of dirt I see my lovely new garden, yay!
