Ginger, galangal, and turmeric.

Two of those three are actually pretty hard to get fresh around here. Galangal and turmeric are rarely for sale as roots. In fact, I've never seen galangal fresh, and only once found fresh turmeric.

I bought that turmeric, cut it up a bit and planted it into some soil. I did the same to some fresh ginger at the same time into much the same pots - then forgot which was which.

Result! But what result? Not really quite sure yet but it seems like turmeric and galangal have done pretty well. I think there is one ginger plant too - the rest just rotted away. I'm pretty pleased with that because I can always buy more ginger and try again, but getting the other two is really hard.

I have about 8 plants now that are doing pretty well - I just need to encourage them and care for them till there's enough to harvest.

All going well I will have a decent number of turmeric and galangal to harvest and transplant to other spots. I might need to shore up my ginger harvest, but that's no biggie.

You literally can't make good Thai food without galangal, lemon grass (doing really great!), kaffir lime (growing well), and chillies (good). So far, so good.

I've also got beans, tomatoes, parsley, horseradish (never had fresh!!!), aubergines and others growing away.

Slowly, but surely, I am expanding my garden and growing more of the foods I want to eat. On Monday we get an excavator in here and things will really change, but that's another day.

I'm not obsessed, you're obsessed.
