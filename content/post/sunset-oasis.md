My first effort towards building a CTF style game went a little awry. I tried tinkering with the gameplay parameters and added in extra elements and came up with a hybrid that might be interesting when I get back to it. My big mistake though was to create a landmass about 8 times bigger than was really needed. Even using much of it for ocean, I was still left with these way too large spaces for the tight gameplay I wanted.<!--more-->

I've stepped away from it for now and made a new, much smaller map. This will be a better place to learn inside since mistakes and misguided steps won't be multiplied out fourfold.

The new map is a temple area inside a canyon in a desert and it's pure CTF.
