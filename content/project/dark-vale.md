Travel into Dark Vale and take a look into madness.

Dark Vale is a project being developed by [Transient Light Studio](http://transientlightstudio.com/) using CRYENGINE 5.x technology.<!--more-->

### Synopsis

You are James Pickett. Whose life has been tumultuous since his mother disappeared in the Ural mountains of Russia, and his father some years later. It is a tale of obsession, loss, and the importance of your memories, both good, and bad. After years of research, and his father's own records and information he left behind. James, along with his best friends Matthew and Katherine head to the Ukraine to discover once and for all what happened, and whether or not they are still alive. What you uncover is chilling, and horrific. And <i>**if**</i> you make it home, you may find you left a lot more in the mountains than your footprints.
