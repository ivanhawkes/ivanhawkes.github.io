# Directions

* Whisk the flour, baking soda, cornstarch, and salt together in a large bowl. Set aside.

* In a medium bowl, whisk the melted butter, brown sugar, and granulated sugar together until no brown sugar lumps remain. Whisk in the egg and egg yolk. Finally, whisk in the vanilla extract. Pour into the dry ingredients and mix together with a rubber spatula. The dough will be very soft, thick, and appear greasy. Fold in the chocolate chips. The chocolate chips may not stick to the dough because of the melted butter, but do your best to combine them.

* Cover the dough tightly and chill in the refrigerator for at least 2–3 hours or up to 3 days. I highly recommend chilling the cookie dough overnight for less spreading.

* Take the dough out of the refrigerator and allow it to slightly soften at room temperature for 10 minutes.

* Preheat oven to 163°C. Line large baking sheets with parchment paper or silicone baking mats.

* Using a cookie scoop or a tablespoon measure out three spoons (about 60g) of dough for XL cookies or two heaping spoons (about 50g) of dough for medium / large cookies.

* Roll into a ball, making sure the shape is taller rather than wide—almost like a cylinder. This helps the cookies bake up thicker. Repeat with remaining dough. Space the dough out over the sheet. Be generous with the space.

* Bake the cookies for 12–13 minutes or until the edges are very lightly browned. (XL cookies can take closer to 14 minutes.) The centers will look very soft, but the cookies will continue to set as they cool. Cool on the baking sheet for 10 minutes.

* Bonus points: press a few extra chocolate chips into the tops of the warm cookies. This is optional and only for looks.

* After 10 minutes of cooling on the baking sheets, transfer cookies to a wire rack to cool completely. 


# Notes

My cookies were already well done after only 11 minutes. Need to play with oven temp and time to dial in this recipe.

I used a scale and measured out 50g cookies.
