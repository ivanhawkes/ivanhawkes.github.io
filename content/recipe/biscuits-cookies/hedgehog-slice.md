This is a biscuit base chocolate recipe that is fast and easy to make. It keeps well in the cupboard or fridge.

In our family, this was always known as fudgecake. It's a recipe mum would make a few times a year as a treat for the family. It requires few ingredients, and no cooking.

Conveniently, each of the major ingredients can be bought at local supermarkets in those sizes.
