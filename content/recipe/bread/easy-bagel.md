Simple bagels done right—it takes a bit of effort to make them the first time, but it’s easier every time thereafter. And the end result is so very worth the time.

# Directions:

* Combine 1 1/2 cups flour and yeast in a large bowl. Combine 1 1/2 cups water, 3 tablespoons sugar, and salt in a medium bowl; pour over flour mixture.
* Beat on low speed for 30 seconds, scraping sides of bowl constantly. Beat 3 minutes on high speed.
* Add remaining flour to mixture; stir gently to mix. Turn dough out onto a lightly floured surface.
* Knead dough 10 minutes, until stiff and elastic. Place in a large greased bowl; cover and allow to rest 15 minutes.
* Cut dough into 12 pieces; shape into smooth balls. Punch a hole in the middle of each with a floured finger. Pull gently to enlarge hole to about 2 inches. Transfer to a greased baking sheet; cover and allow to rise 20 minutes.
* Preheat broiler. Bring remaining gallon water and 1 tablespoon sugar to a boil in a large pot over high heat; reduce to a simmer.
* Place bagels under broiler and cook 90 seconds on each side. Reduce oven temperature to 400°F. Transfer to simmering water in batches of 5; cook 8 minutes and remove to a paper towel-lined plate. Repeat with remaining bagels.
* Place drained bagels on greased baking sheet. Bake 25 minutes, until golden.
* Cool and serve.
