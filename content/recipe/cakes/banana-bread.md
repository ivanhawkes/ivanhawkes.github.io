Whenever there are over-ripe bananas in the house, it's time to make this cake.

Quantity	| Measure 		| Ingredient
------------|---------------|-----------
125			| grams			| butter (softened)
1    		| cup 			| brown sugar (firmly packed, 220g)
2    		| cup 			| icing sugar (sifted)
1/4			| cup			| milk
1			| tsp			| vanilla extract
{{</table>}}

# Instructions

* Melt the butter and sugar in a saucepan on moderate heat. Stir constantly.

* Add the milk and bring to the boil for one minute.

* Remove from the heat and wait until it is lukewarm.

* Add the icing sugar. Beat well. You can add more icing sugar if it's too thin, or water if it's too thick.

* Cool in the fridge until it's ready to apply to the cake.

# Notes

The bananas can be frozen if they are at risk of going completely rotten.

The original recipe did not include cinnamon or walnuts. I have added these for extra flavour.

Consider adding some lemon juice to the icing to give it more acidity.
