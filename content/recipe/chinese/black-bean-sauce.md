Quantity		| Measure 			| Ingredient
----------------|-------------------|-----------
1				| cup 				| fermented black beans
1/2				| cup 				| garlic
1				| cup 				| vegetable oil
2				| tbs 				| unsalted roasted peanuts

{{</table>}}

# Directions

* Stir fry the fermented black bean in pan without oil for around 1 to 2 minutes until they are separated from each other. Transfer out.

* Pour around 1 cup of vegetable oil in wok or pan; add chopped garlic cloves to stir fry over medium fire until you can smell the aroma. Add fried fermented black beans. Use slow fire to continue frying for 5-8 minutes.

* Add roasted peanuts, sesame seeds, chili pepper powder and Chinese five spice powder in. Mix well.

* Add sugar and light soy sauce in. Combine well. Remove from fire to cool down.

Transfer to airtight container for around 1 or 2 days so all the ingredients can combine well. Serve directly as appetizers, with steamed rice or apply in recipes.

# Notes

This black bean sauce can be kept for months in airtight container if the content is well soaked with oil. 
If you want to add mushrooms, chicken or beef, do deep-frying or roast them to remove the water.
