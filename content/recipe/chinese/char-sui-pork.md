# Instructions

* Mix the marinade ingredients together in a bowl.

* Slice the pork into 2.5 centimetre thick pieces, allowing for a good portion of the fat to run through the meat. Place the meat and the marinade into a bag, remove all the air and seal it shut. Place in the fridge and let sit for 8-24 hours. Reserve a portion of the marinade for brushing on during cooking.

* Bake for 12 minutes at a time. Each 12 minutes remove the pork from the oven, coat both sides in the reserved marinade and return to the over. Repeat 2-4 times for a total of 24-48 minutes cooking time (as preferred).

Alternatively:

* Place on mesh over tray with a cup of water under it. Tent the tray with aluminium foil.

* Place tray in the middle of the oven heated to 150c. Cook for 20 minutes then uncover. Cook for 40 minutes.

* Switch to using the grill. Dry both sides of the meat by heating in middle of oven using grill for about 6 minutes / side.

* Glaise the meat and cook for 6 mins a side, flipping and basting as you go. Try to get a little char on the meat and a glossy glaise.

# Notes

You may prefer to use Hoisin sauce instead of or in addition to the oyster sauce.

Pork butt or shoulder is best, but this can also be made using the belly.
