This version of the dish is similar to one from a take-away place, though it is less sweet than usual.

# Instructions

* Marinate the pork for 1 - 4 hours.

* Prepare the sweet and sour sauce by combining all the ingredients into a pot and bringing to a simmer for 5 minutes.

* Cut all the vegetables and have them ready.

* Prepare a paper towell lined wire rack.

* Add oil (enough for a shallow fry) to a wok and heat to 170 C.

* Batter:

	* Option 1: Dredge in even mix of potato starch and corn flour. Let pieces sit in the flour until completely dry and coated on the outside. This will give you a lovely crunchy coating.

	* Option 2: Use a [Light Batter](/recipe/batter/light-batter/) recipe.

* Fry the pork in the pre-heated oil. Fry until each piece is golden brown and then transfer to the prepared rack.

* Fry the onion, carrot, capsicum, and pineapple until bright in color and just barely cooked.

* Add the shallots. Fry for a few seconds only.

* Add the pork back into the wok.

* Coat the battered pork and vegetables with the marinade and serve quickly before it all turns to mush.
