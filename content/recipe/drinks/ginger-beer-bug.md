A ginger beer bug is the first step to making a traditional ginger beer. It is a living organism containing yeast from your work area.

# Ingredients

On the first day...

{{<table "table table-striped table-bordered">}}
Quantity	| Measure 		| Ingredient
------------|---------------|-----------
500 		| ml 			| water (chlorine free) - 2 cups
125 		| g 			| white sugar - 10 tbs
25	 		| g 			| organic ginger root - a roughly 5cm long piece
{{</table>}}

After the bug has been started add these ingredients every day when it is active. This can be done once a week instead if you keep the bug in the fridge. This process should be repeated every day for at least five days. Keep repeating until you have a mature bug.

Quantity	| Measure 		| Ingredient
------------|---------------|-----------
25	 		| g 			| sucrose - white sugar (2 tsp)
25	 		| g 			| organic ginger root - a roughly 5cm long piece
{{</table>}}

# Directions

Try to maintain a clean work space at all times. It doesn't have to be sterile, but any bacteria that is on your tools will end up in the jar and may taint the flavour of the ferment.

* Start the bug off by taking the sugar and water and combining together in a jar.

* Use a microplane to grate the ginger, skin and all, into the jar. The skin contains a lot of the free wild yeasts that you will need to make this ferment.

* Stir the ferment then place a clean cloth over the jar - ensuring it is open to the air. Under no conditions seal the jar as this can cause a buildup of pressure and an explosion.

After a week or so you can place the ferment into the fridge and cover losely with a fitted lid. Do not screw up or afix the lid as this can cause a buildup of pressure and an explosion. Feed the bug every week when it is stored in the fridge.
