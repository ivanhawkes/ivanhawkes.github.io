# Instructions

* Mix it all in a large bowl.

* Split the mix into twelve even amounts.

* Take the six sheets of pastry and divide them right down the middle.

* Take a lump of the filling and spread it out along the pastry. Roll it up. Make sure there is a little overlap.

* Pop onto a tray and place into an oven set at 180 degrees celcius.

* Cook for about 20 minutes. Faster in an air fryer, slower in a convection oven.

* Cut each roll in half.

* Freeze the excess rolls.
