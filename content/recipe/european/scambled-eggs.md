Lovely, soft, buttery scrambled eggs.

Quantity        | Measure           | Ingredient
----------------|-------------------|-----------
3               | whole             | eggs
2               | tbs               | water
1               | tsp               | tapioca flour (or cornstarch)
1/2             | tsp               | salt
1/2             | tsp               | ground white pepper
1/2             | tsp               | ground black pepper
2               | tbs               | butter
{{</table>}}

# Instructions

* In a bowl add the water and tapioca flour. Mix well.

* Crack all the eggs into the bowl.

* Add the salt and pepper. Whisk lightly with a fork.

* Get the frying pan nice and hot and add the butter. Wait for it to melt.

* Pour in the eggs and get ready, this part happens fast. Wait for the eggs to form a skin on the bottom, then shove them gently to one side of the pan. The liquid eggs will flow into the now empty space. Repeat a couple of times until all the eggs have been exposed to the pan. You should have a small pile of "almost" fully cooked eggs. You want it to just be past the runny stage, but maybe a little runny inside the pile.

* Serve on buttered toast.

# Notes

You can cut back the butter a little if you're watching your weight, but it really does make them extra creamy and improve the mouth-feel.

Don't use olive / canola oil. The eggs will slide around freely in butter, not so much in other forms of oil.
