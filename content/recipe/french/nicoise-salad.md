# Ingredients

Quantity		| Measure 			| Ingredient
----------------|-------------------|-----------
200				| grams				| tuna
3				| 					| eggs (hard boiled)
4				| 					| potatos (boiled, small or new)
1				| head				| cos lettuce
1				| 					| tomato

200				| grams				| green beans

1				| tbs				| capers
6				| whole				| anchovies

# Instructions

* Make a vinaigrette. In a jar, place the oil, lemon juice or vinegar, shallots, herbs, and mustard. Cover with a lid and shake until well blended. Add salt and pepper to taste. You can follow the recipe provided http://www.bigoven.com/recipe/vinaigrette/2283662

* Place onion slices in a small bowl and sprinkle with 3 tbs of the vinaigrette (the onions soaking in the vinaigrette will help take some of the bite out of them.)

* Place potatos in a large pot and cover with 2 inches of water. Add 1 tbs of salt. Heat on high to bring to a boil. Lower the heat to maintain a simmer. Cook for 10 to 12 minutes or so, until the potatos are fork tender. Drain.

* While the potatos are still warm, cut them into halves or quarters, depending on the size of the potatos. Place them in a bowl and dress them with about 1/4 cup of the vinaigrette.

* While the potatos are cooking, fill a medium sized pot halfway with water, and add 2 teaspoons of salt. Bring to a boil on high heat. Add the green beans to the boiling water. Cook until tender but still firm to the bite, about 3-5 minutes (more or less, depending on the toughness of the beans).

* Drain and either rinse with cold water to stop the cooking, or shock for half a minute in ice water.

* Arrange a bed of lettuce on a serving platter. Cut tuna into 1/2 inch thick slices. Mound tuna in center of lettuce. Sprinkle the tomatoes and onions around the tuna.

* Arrange the potatos and green beans in mounds at the edge of the lettuce.

* Arrange hard boiled eggs, olives, and anchovies in mounds on the lettuce bed.

* Drizzle everything with the remaining vinaigrette. Sprinkle with capers.

Serve immediately. Should be served slightly warm or at room temperature.
