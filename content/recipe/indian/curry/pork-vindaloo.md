# Instructions

* Cube the pork into one inch sized chunks.

* Add the vinegar, ginger, garlic, and spices into a blender. Blend into a puree.

* Massage the marinade into the pork.

* Place it in the fridge and let it marinate for a few hours or overnight.

* Heat the oil in a pan over medium-high heat.

* Add the marinated pork. Stir occasionally for about 15 minutes. You're looking to see the oil split from the meat.

* Pour in Â½ cup of water and scrape the bottom of the pan to deglaze it. Reduce the heat to medium-low, cover, and simmer, stirring occasionally, until the pork is tender, about 15 minutes.

* Stir in the cilantro, and serve.

# Notes

I substituted 6 tablespoons of kashmiri chilli powder for the chillies. It was quite hot, but not uncomfortably so. You will need to determine the right amount of chilli for your tastes.

I recommend cooking this for 20 minutes using a pressure cooker instead of the method shown above. I will test this next time and amend the recipe if the results are better.

You might want to serve this with a cooling yoghurt side dish to help cool the mouth.
