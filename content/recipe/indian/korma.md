## Preparation

* Break the chicken down into serving sized parts.

* Add the yoghurt, ginger, and garlic into a dish with the chicken. Make sure all the chicken is coated.

* Let it marinate for a few hours.

## Instructions

* Dry fry the spices if desired.

* Grind the spices in a mortar and pestle.

* Add the oil and onion to the pan and fry until slightly browned.

* Add the spices, cinnamon and bay leaves and fry to release their oils.

* Grind the almonds and add to the pan.

* Add the water to smooth out the paste.

* Add the chicken, simmer till done.

# Optional method

Some will prefer this as a creamy sauce. In which case, the sauce is transferred to a blender after the onion is browned, then spices and nuts are added and blended until creamy.
