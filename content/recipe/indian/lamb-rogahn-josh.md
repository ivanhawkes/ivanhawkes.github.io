## Ingredients

Quantity        | Measure           | Ingredient
----------------|-------------------|-----------
4               | tbs               | ghee
2               | tbs               | black cumin seed
2               | tsp               | fennel
24              | whole             | cloves
8               | whole             | black cardamom pods
4               | whole             | bay leaves (Indian, dried or fresh)
4               | sticks            | cinnamon (3 inches long each)
2               | cups              | red onion (medium, finely chopped)
4               | tbs               | tomato paste
2               | tbs               | Kashmiri chiles (ground) or 1/2 tbs cayenne mixed with 1 1/2 tbs sweet paprika

## Instructions

* Heat the ghee in a frying pan over medium-high heat.

* Toss in all the spices. Stir fry these until they release their aromas, around 30 seconds. Immediately add the onion to prevent the spices from burning. Cook until lightly brown, 4 to 6 minutes.

* Add the lamb. Stir occasionally for about 15 minutes. You're looking to see the oil split from the meat.

* Stir in the tomato paste and Kashmiri chillies. Stir and coat the lamb with the paste this forms. Optionally, use a tin of tomatoes if you don't have any tomato paste.

* Deglaze with 2 cups of water. Scrape any fond from the bottom of the pan.

* Pressure cook for 20 minutes. Natural steam release.

* Serve with rice, naan, raita and other accompaniments.

# Notes

I cooked it for 30 minutes the first time. The lamb was very tender, but could use less cooking time for best results. Try 20 minutes or 25 minutes next time and update the recipe when the best cook time is found.
