# Ingredients

{{<table "table table-striped table-bordered">}}
Quantity		| Measure 			| Ingredient
----------------|-------------------|-----------
1/2				| cup				| all-purpose flour
1⁄2				| cup				| cornflour
1				| tsp				| sodium bicarbonate
1⁄2				| teaspoon			| salt
3/4				| cup				| soda water (cold)
1				|					| egg
{{</table>}}

# Directions

* In a mixing bowl, combine the flour, cornstarch, sodium bicarbonate, and salt. Mix together.

* Crack an egg into a bowl and beat it before adding it to the mix and gently combining.

* Add the soda water. Try to keep the batter temperature quite low as this will prevent the sodium bicarbonate from reacting until it is placed into the fryer.

# Experimental

Try to replace some of the soda water with milk and see how that affects the lightness of the batter. It should allow the sodium bicarbonate to react earlier with the soda water. It's unknown if this is desireable since it will affect colour, taste and lightness of the batter.
