# Directions

* Mix it all together in a stand mixer. You want to churn the meat until it becomes a little sticky and rubbery from the fat breaking down.

* Form into skewers or sausages.

* Lay it out on trays in the freezer. Freeze it, then bag it.

* Pull it out on meal night and cook it in the air fryer, then place into wraps / pita with some salad, garlic yoghurt, etc.

# Optional

* Feel free to experiment with the meat component.
