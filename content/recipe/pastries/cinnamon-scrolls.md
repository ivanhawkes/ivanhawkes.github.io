# Instructions

* Place yeast, milk, butter and sugar in the bowl of an electric mixer. Stir to combine, then stand for 10 minutes or until bubbles form and yeast has dissolved.

* Preheat oven to 200°c / 180°c if fan-forced. Grease and line a 30 x 40cm baking tray with baking paper.

* Add flour, baking powder and salt flakes to yeast mixture. Using a dough hook, knead for 10 minutes or until a smooth dough forms. Cover with a clean tea towel, then set aside in a warm place for 1 hour or until doubled in size. Work it by hand for a minimal amount of time if you wish to achieve a doughnut like consistency.

* For the cinnamon butter, place all the ingredients in a bowl and stir until combined.

* Turn dough out onto a lightly floured surface. Add remaining flour and knead for 5 minutes or until smooth. Using a lightly floured rolling pin, roll out dough to a 1cm-thick, 37 x 45cm rectangle. Spread with cinnamon butter. Starting from one long end, roll up to form a log. Cut into 3cm-thick slices. Arrange slices, cut-sides up, on tray. Cover with a clean towel and stand for 30 minutes or until slightly risen.

* Make the cream cheese drizzle. Beat all the ingredients together in a bowl until smooth and creamy. Set aside.

* Bake scrolls for 20 minutes or until risen and golden. Drizzle cream cheese mixture over scrolls, then serve.
