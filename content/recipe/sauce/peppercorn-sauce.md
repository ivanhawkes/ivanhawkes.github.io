The classic Steak Au Poivre sauce. Rich, creamy and peppery, this pairs very well with steak and chips.

# Directions

* Melt the butter in the saucepan and add the garlic and shallots. Fry on a low heat for 5 minutes.

* Crush the black pepper in a mortar and pestle. You want a mix of fine powder, medium, and some larger chunks.

* Add the pepper to the pan and a little oil if needed. Fry it off for a few minutes to ensure the pepper oils are released.

* Add the green peppers to the pan.

* Add the beef stock and worcestershire sauce. Cook off for a few minutes.

* Add the brandy and flame off.

* Add the cream. Bring to a mild simmer and allow it to reduce until it thickens (approximately 10-15 minutes).
