A basic stock used for a lot of Japanese recipes.
<!--more-->

# Ichiban Dashi (First Sea Stock)

Makes 4 cups.

## Ingredients

Quantity		| Measure 			| Ingredient
----------------|-------------------|-----------
1				| litre				| water (cold)
10				| cm square piece	| kombu (13-18 grams)
1/2				| cup				| loosely packed katsuobushi (dried bonito flakes)

* Place the water and the kombu in a pot and let the kombu soak for about 15 minutes.

* Place the pot over medium heat.

* Right before the water starts to boil remove the kombu.

* Remove the pot from the heat and scatter the katsuobushi over the surface of the water.

* After 3 or 4 minutes (the katsuobushi will have sunk to the bottom of the pot by this point), strain the stock through a strainer lined with a tightly woven cotton cloth or a coffee-filter.

* Refrigerate the stock in a tightly covered container for up to 4 days in the refrigerator.

Sources disagree on whether ichiban dashi can be frozen.  Some say that it can be frozen, while others argue that the stock loses its aroma / flavor when frozen, so it’s best to use it when it’s fresh.  It’s up to you!

## Ingredients

Quantity		| Measure 			| Ingredient

* Refrigerate the stock in a tightly covered container for up to 4 days in the refrigerator.
