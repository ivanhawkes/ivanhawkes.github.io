# Instructions

* Place the meat into a bowl. Add 1 tbs of fish sauce and 1/2 tsp sodium bicarbonate. This needs to sit for 15-30 minutes before cooking to tenderise the meat.
* Take about 1/3 of the coconut milk and add to a hot pan. Boil it for several minutes until the milk splits out of the oil. You will use this oil to fry the paste.
* Toss the paste into the hot oil and fry out for several minutes, until the paste and oil separate.
* Bruise the lime leaves before adding them. Give them a minute to fry in the paste and oil.
* Throw in the palm sugar and allow it to fry in the oil to develop extra flavour.
* Add the rest of the coconut milk and stir to incorporate it.
* Add the fresh ingredients and nuts, except for the coriander leaves and birdseye chilies.
* Stir and simmer for a few minutes.
* Add the basil leaves.
* Simmer for a few minutes.
* Add the fish sauce and the juice of one lime.
* Stir and take it off the heat.
* Finish it with a small handful of coriander leaves and birdseye chilies.

# Serving

* Provide slices of lime, extra chili, and a bottle of fish sauce on the table for guests.
