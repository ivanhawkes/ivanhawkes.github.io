# Instructions

* Preheat oven to 220 degrees celcius.

* Place beef bones on a baking sheet and roast in the preheated oven until browned, about 1 hour.

* Place onion on a baking sheet and roast in the preheated oven until blackened and soft, about 45 minutes.

* Place bones, onion, ginger, salt, star anise, and fish sauce in a large stockpot and cover with water. Bring to a boil and reduce heat to low. Simmer on low for 6 to 10 hours. Strain the broth into a saucepan and set aside.

* Place rice noodles in large bowl filled with room temperature water and allow to soak for 1 hour. Bring a large pot of water to a boil and after the noodles have soaked, place them in the boiling water for 1 minute. Bring stock to a simmer.

* Divide noodles among 4 serving bowls; top with sirloin, cilantro, and green onion. Pour hot broth over the top. Stir and let sit until the beef is partially cooked and no longer pink, 1 to 2 minutes. Serve with bean sprouts, Thai basil, lime wedges, hoisin sauce, and chilli-garlic sauce on the side.
