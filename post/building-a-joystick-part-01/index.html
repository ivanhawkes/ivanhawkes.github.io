I&rsquo;m an almost teenage boy, and I&rsquo;ve just discovered both arcade machines and general purpose computers. Both of these discoveries will have significant impact on the rest of my life.</p><p>The first, is a <strong>Space Invaders</strong> machine at the local corner store. It goes <strong>PEW PEW</strong> and has a merciless gameplay loop that demands mastery. It costs 20 cents for each attempt, and it&rsquo;s a harsh task-master. It requires skill, patience, timing, and an abundance of coins that I just don&rsquo;t have.</p><p>It&rsquo;s possible to die within seconds of dropping your coin into the slot. It&rsquo;s also possible to learn the moves and, over time, last all the way to the end of the first level. The reward for doing so is re-entering the level, with less lives, and potentially slightly faster invaders. Were they faster or was it just my nerves as I attempted to clear the level for a second time?</p><p>Drop enough coins into the guts of the machine and you will begin to clock it on the regular.</p><p>The second machine was far more important over the long timeline, though it may not have seemed so at the time.</p><p>At the local library was a <a href=https://collection.maas.museum/object/456918>Dick Smith System 80</a> computer.</p><p>It&rsquo;s the 80s, and I&rsquo;m twelve, so I have no idea about the specs of the machine. All I know is it&rsquo;s a computer, it runs BASIC, the library has a book that can teach me BASIC, and they will let me book time slots to use the machine. The book promises to teach me BASIC in 8 hours&mldr;I am skeptical.</p><p>That&rsquo;s not how it starts, of course. It starts with me sitting there and playing games for hours on end.</p><p>Every day I run straight from school to the library. I book a time slot and borrow a cassette with a game on it. I load that game and play it.</p><p>At some point, a change agent enters the scene. A slighter older teen with a little arcane knowledge. They show me how to hold down CTRL-C and interupt the game.</p><p>This doesn&rsquo;t always work. Some cassettes switch off this ability, but enough have left it open that we can start to look at the guts of the programs. It&rsquo;s code written in the BASIC language.</p><p>He shows me the code, and how to change a few lines. It&rsquo;s mostly PRINT statements getting changed for now but that&rsquo;s enough to spark my interest.</p><p>I&rsquo;ve learnt that the computer runs on something called BASIC, and I can learn BASIC right there in the library. I place a reserve on the book and become the first and only person to check out that book. I keep that book out for weeks as I learn the language that can control this machine.</p><p>IF, THEN, ELSE, FOR, NEXT, GOTO, PRINT..there&rsquo;s so much power in so few statements. I start by hacking on the programs the library has on cassette, but in time I start to write my own code from scratch. I read the book twice.</p><p>I&rsquo;m addicted. I want more and there&rsquo;s only one path forward.</p><p>I get a job washing cars at 7am in a second hand car lot. It&rsquo;s not bad work in Summer, but it&rsquo;s pretty hellish in Winter. I save up enough money to buy an entry level machine.</p><p>I&rsquo;m a 12 year old living in the poor suburbs of Sydney, so my options are limited. I find an ad in a paper for an <a href=http://www.oldcomputers.net/osi-600.html>Ohio Scientific Superboard II computer</a>. The price which is approximately $250AUD is within my budget - though it&rsquo;s not quite what I&rsquo;ve grown to expect from the machines in Tandy and the Apple / etc store.</p><p>Arriving at the house of a tech enthusiast, I see the Superboard is literally just a PCB with a keyboard on it. Lucky, the guy has a couple of other things on offer - including a Commodore Pet. I don&rsquo;t go for the PET, it&rsquo;s also out of my range, but he has an OSI C1P and I can just barely afford it.</p><p>It has 8KB of RAM, 5KB of which was addressable. It has a case, which is a big step up from the Superboard II. It&rsquo;s also got a very useful mod - a &ldquo;dah-bug&rdquo; he called it&mldr;though I&rsquo;ve never seen any information on it since. It allowed for a 40x12 (IIRC) video mode, and quick-key entry of common BASIC statements e.g. hit a key and Q and the word NEXT appeared in the BASIC editor. As you can imagine, my FOR loops looked like this:</p><div class=highlight><pre tabindex=0 style=color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4><code class=language-BASIC data-lang=BASIC><span style=display:flex><span><span style=color:#66d9ef>FOR</span> Q <span style=color:#f92672>=</span> <span style=color:#ae81ff>1</span> to <span style=color:#ae81ff>10</span>
</span></span><span style=display:flex><span>    <span style=color:#66d9ef>LET</span> X <span style=color:#f92672>=</span> Q
</span></span><span style=display:flex><span><span style=color:#66d9ef>NEXT</span> Q
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>Saving keystrokes FTW.</p><p>Back then, the machines came with user manuals which contained block diagrams, schematics, and all sorts of information I wasn&rsquo;t equipped to understand.</p><p>With my own machine, I am finally no longer limited to the opening hours of the library. I start to crank out code till the wee hours. I purchase a few books on BASIC programming, some with listings. I type in listings from magazines and books I borrow or purchase. I flip through, and then (cheekily) start to flat out read the books at a local computer store. God knows why they tolerated me spending hours on their showroom floor flipping through their magazines, playing with their machines&mldr;but they did, bless.</p><p>On my machine there&rsquo;s no sound, no colour, no sprites, nothing but a 40x25 character matrix, the PETSCI character set, and BASIC&mldr;but that&rsquo;s enough. Except, there was one more thing&mldr;a monitor that let you enter machine code.</p><p>I pushed my BASIC skills to the limit, along with the very low limit of 5KB of addressable RAM. I hit a wall&mldr;one that would only be unlocked by learning 6502 Assembly language.</p><p>That long suffering computer store had their second purchase from me, a book on how to program a KIM-1 in assembly code. The first was a floppy disk I used for scratch.</p><p>I&rsquo;ll finish up here, although there&rsquo;s plenty left to tell. Twelve year old me is now thirteen, can program in 6502 assembler, and is hoping like heck to write their own version of Space Invaders. I never complete that dream, though I come pretty close at the time. I&rsquo;m still planning on finishing my teenage aspirations&mldr;but first, some side quests.</p></div></div><div class=row><div class=col-12><hr></div></div><div class=row><div class=col><p class=h6>Discover more posts like this:</p><p class=h6></p></div></div><div class=row><div class=col><hr></div></div><div class=row><div class="col-6 text-start">Previous:<br><a href=https://ivanhawkes.github.io/post/installing-nginx-on-docker/>Installing Nginx using Docker and Portainer</a></div><div class="col-6 text-end">Next:<br><a href=https://ivanhawkes.github.io/post/first-steps-with-fpga/>First Steps with FPGA</a></div></div></div></div><footer><div class=row><div class=col><hr></div></div><nav class="navbar navbar-expand-lg"><div class=container-fluid>&copy; 2021 Ivan Hawkes all rights reserved.</div></nav></footer><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.1.3/dist/css/bootstrap.min.css integrity=sha384-1BmE4kWBq78iYhFldvKuhfTAU6auU8tT94WrHftjDbrCEXSU1oBoqyl2QvZ6jIW3 crossorigin=anonymous><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.0.2/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js integrity=sha384-MrcW6ZMFYlzcLA8Nl+NtUVF0sA7MsXsP1UyJoMp4YLEuNSfAP+JcXn/tWtIaxVXM crossorigin=anonymous></script><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap-icons@1.6.0/font/bootstrap-icons.css integrity=sha384-7ynz3n3tAGNUYFZD3cWe5PDcE36xj85vyFkawcF6tIwxvIecqKvfwLiaFdizhPpN crossorigin=anonymous><link rel=stylesheet type=text/css href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Roboto:300,400,500,700|Roboto+Slab:400,700|Material+Icons"></body></html>
