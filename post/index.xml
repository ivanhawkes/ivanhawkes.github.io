We need to take a few steps back into the past to see the real truth.
Jump back 31 years and you will find a very young version of me taking his first steps into the world of computing. My options at this point are limited in ways I wouldn&amp;rsquo;t be able to see for decades.</description></item><item><title>Building A Joystick (Part 1)</title><link>https://ivanhawkes.github.io/post/building-a-joystick-part-01/</link><pubDate>Wed, 15 Dec 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://ivanhawkes.github.io/post/building-a-joystick-part-01/</guid><description>&lt;p>The long and boring story of how I went from a 12 year old boy in the 80&amp;rsquo;s to a 50 year old man in the 2020&amp;rsquo;s making a joystick to play retro-arcade games from the 80&amp;rsquo;s.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Installing Nginx using Docker and Portainer</title><link>https://ivanhawkes.github.io/post/installing-nginx-on-docker/</link><pubDate>Wed, 24 Nov 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://ivanhawkes.github.io/post/installing-nginx-on-docker/</guid><description>&lt;p>Quick instructions on getting Nginx up and running again for my site using Docker and Portainer.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Moving into a Fresh Ubuntu Install</title><link>https://ivanhawkes.github.io/post/moving-into-ubuntu/</link><pubDate>Fri, 19 Nov 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://ivanhawkes.github.io/post/moving-into-ubuntu/</guid><description>&lt;p>Instructions for a quick start getting all my usual software and setup on a fresh Ubuntu Linux install.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Chrysalis Update for 2020-08-02</title><link>https://ivanhawkes.github.io/post/chrysalis-update-2020-08-02/</link><pubDate>Sun, 02 Aug 2020 21:48:08 +1000</pubDate><guid>https://ivanhawkes.github.io/post/chrysalis-update-2020-08-02/</guid><description>&lt;p>In this article I will cover recent progress on my project, &lt;a href="https://github.com/ivanhawkes/Chrysalis">Chrysalis&lt;/a>.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Adding EnTT ECS to Chrysalis</title><link>https://ivanhawkes.github.io/post/adding-an-ecs-to-chrysalis/</link><pubDate>Tue, 31 Dec 2019 22:48:08 +1000</pubDate><guid>https://ivanhawkes.github.io/post/adding-an-ecs-to-chrysalis/</guid><description>&lt;p>In this article I will discuss the process I followed and the results of integrating the &lt;a href="https://github.com/skypjack/entt">EnTT&lt;/a> Entity Component System (ECS) into Chrysalis.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Switching to CRYENGINE 5.3 New Entity System</title><link>https://ivanhawkes.github.io/post/switching-to-cryengine-5-3-new-entity-system/</link><pubDate>Sun, 08 Jan 2017 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://ivanhawkes.github.io/post/switching-to-cryengine-5-3-new-entity-system/</guid><description>&lt;p>In this article I will cover the changes I made to &lt;a href="https://github.com/ivanhawkes/Chrysalis">&lt;strong>Chrysalis&lt;/strong>&lt;/a> for the release of CRYENGINE 5.3.

I tried tinkering with the gameplay parameters and added in extra elements and came up with a hybrid that might be interesting when I get back to it.
