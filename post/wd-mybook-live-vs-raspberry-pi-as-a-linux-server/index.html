<p>I&rsquo;ve spent a lot of time in the last few months playing around with low power Linux based devices. As power becomes more expensive, and computers push out more heat and noise I find myself looking for ways to enjoy the comforts of always-on-service without paying the heat and noise toll.</p>
<p>In this article I will contrast the <a href=http://www.raspberrypi.org/ title="Raspberry Pi">Raspberry Pi</a> with a <a href="http://www.wdc.com/en/products/products.aspx?id=280" title="WD MyBook Live">Western Digital MyBook Live</a> hard drive.</p>
<p>In the past I have run servers (2U rackmount Dell machines, re-purposed ancient hardware) within my own home, pulling large amounts of electricity and creating large amounts of heat and noise. I simply accepted at the time that if I wanted a certain level of service, I would need to pay the price.</p>
<p>It was the <a href=http://www.raspberrypi.org/ title="Raspberry Pi">Raspberry Pi</a> that first drew me into the low power sphere, though; it could be argued that my time working with Linux on XBox was the first true experience. The Raspberry Pi is a small, low power, low cost and low heat computer that is capable of running GNU Linux. It draw&rsquo;s strength from the enormous wealth of GNU Linux, making it a strangely capable machine for single purpose applications.</p>
<p>Now, the <a href=http://www.raspberrypi.org/ title="Raspberry Pi">Raspberry Pi</a> is excellent as a low power device, wonderful as a teaching tool, but truly awful as a file server. This is where the <a href="http://www.wdc.com/en/products/products.aspx?id=280" title="WD MyBook Live">WD MyBook Live</a> enters the scene.</p>
<p>The major problem with the Pi in many tasks comes down to a simple trade-off they made in it&rsquo;s design. The Pi uses the same bus to handle USB and Network, and only comes with a 10mbs network connection. This makes it less than ideal at tasks it should be able to handle quite well. In practical tests, I generally only manage to transfer between 3-6MB/s between my main PC and the PI. That completely rules the PI out as a backup server and makes it a pain to use for a media server. Who wants to spend 30 minutes copying over a new HD torrent?</p>
<p>It turns out there is a really good alternative for file serving that still gets you a lot of the tasty things you get with a Pi. While looking for new hard drives to store my growing media collection on I stumbled on the <a href="http://www.wdc.com/en/products/products.aspx?id=280" title="WD MyBook Live">Western Digital MyBook Live</a> series of drives.</p>
<p>These drives combine a fast, 3TB hard drive with a 1gbs ethernet connection, a PowerPC CPU and Linux. All that adds up to opportunity.</p>
<p>Within minutes of spinning up one of these drives and connecting to it, you can have <a href=http://community.wd.com/t5/My-Book-Live/What-are-the-steps-to-enable-SSH/m-p/324423#M7544 title="Root Access Over SSH">root access</a> to it over SSH without using any hacks. Fire up your favourite SSH client and you can now connect to the drive as root. That&rsquo;s right, you have root access to a 1gbs 3TB hard drive with a decent Linux distro on it.</p>
<p>I really only needed to add two things for my day to day needs. Firstly, I added a copy of <a href=http://www.transmissionbt.com/ title=Transmission>Transmission</a> to allow me to use the hard drive to pull down torrents for me while my main machine is sleeping. Something about the idea of a hard drive that actually downloads torrents to itself makes me giggle. I access this remotely using the Transmission client on my PC to talk to the back end on this drive. I can seamlessly click a link on a site on my PC and have the back end hard drive download it for me.</p>
<p>Second, I placed a copy of <a href=http://www.bittorrent.com/sync title=BTSync>BTSync</a> onto the machine. This allows me to sync large amounts of files with other people over the net. It&rsquo;s great for teams who need to swap large amounts of possibly huge files. No need to pay huge sums of cash to get cloud hosting or for DropBox / etc, and best of all, it&rsquo;s totally private.</p>
<p>Installation of the software is easy enough. You pull it in using Optware commands and there is a wide range available out of the box. You could always compile yourself if needed, but I saw pretty much everything I would need in the repository already.</p>
<h2 id=performance>Performance</h2>
<p>I&rsquo;m not going to bother with a vast array of performance tests. I&rsquo;ll just impart this one fact. The <a href=http://www.raspberrypi.org/ title="Raspberry Pi">Raspberry Pi</a> can transfer files at 3-6MBs, and the WD MyBook Live can do so at 70MBs. It&rsquo;s well over 10 times as fast. If you want to perform backups to this device, or move large files around, you want the <a href="http://www.wdc.com/en/products/products.aspx?id=280" title="WD MyBook Live">WD MyBook Live</a>.</p>
<h2 id=cost>Cost</h2>
<p>You can purchase a Raspberry Pi for $35USD, and the sundries for $20-40USD more. It&rsquo;s not hard to get a Raspberry Pi up and running for $50-$75USD, but&mldr;you then need to add the cost of storage. The Pi would need a USB2/3 hard drive of similar size to the equivalent WD MyBook Live. Here, in Australia, you can buy 3TB of USB drive space for $150. For $200, you can order online from JB Hi Fi a 3TB WD MyBook live hard drive .</p>
<p>In this case the Pi costs $50-$75USD above the cost of pure HD storage, and the <a href="http://www.wdc.com/en/products/products.aspx?id=280" title="WD MyBook Live">WD MyBook Live</a> costs $50AUS (about $42USD) above the baseline cost.</p>
<h2 id=xbmc>XBMC</h2>
<p>One of the primary uses of these hard drives is to provide <a href=http://xbmc.org/ title=XBMC>XMBC</a> access to my media collection. So far, I have done this entirely over SMB. Recently the <a href=https://www.ouya.tv/ title=Ouya>Ouya</a> I was using to provide XBMC to the upstairs part of the house decided to die&mldr;mostly due to a lightning strike taking out the wired Ethernet. I can&rsquo;t blame it really; the same strike took out the router too.</p>
<p>With it&rsquo;s primary ethernet dead I had to take drastic measures and factory reset the Ouya. It&rsquo;s now running on the wireless ethernet. I did try and connect it back up to the SMB shares, but most likely because I forgot to set up a username and password, they failed - utterly. Lucky the <a href="http://www.wdc.com/en/products/products.aspx?id=280" title="WD MyBook Live">WD MyBook Live</a> drives also provide NFS and I was able to connect up using that.</p>
<p>Whatever people may say about the <a href=https://www.ouya.tv/ title=Ouya>Ouya</a> as a game console, there is no doubting it is a terrific <a href=http://xbmc.org/ title=XBMC>XBMC</a> front end.</p>
<h2 id=conclusion>Conclusion</h2>
<p>If you want pure hard fast transfer speeds, decent access to standard GNU Linux software, then choose the <a href="http://www.wdc.com/en/products/products.aspx?id=280" title="WD MyBook Live">WD MyBook Live</a> drives. They are cheap, fast, and expandable.</p>
<p>If you want a general purpose, low power, useful PC&mldr;then the Pi is the best choice. Both are good in their domains.</p>
