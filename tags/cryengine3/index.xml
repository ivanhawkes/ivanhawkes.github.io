Blacklists and substitutions for Flowgraph Nodes are one way to improve these parts of your project.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Matrices, Vectors, Quaternions and CryEngine 3</title><link>https://www.hawkes.info/post/matrices-vectors-quaternions-and-cryengine-3/</link><pubDate>Sat, 21 Jun 2014 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.hawkes.info/post/matrices-vectors-quaternions-and-cryengine-3/</guid><description>&lt;p>This article will introduce you to matrices, vectors and quaternions and how you can use them for programming games using the &lt;a href="http://cryengine.com" title="CryEngine">CryEngine SDK&lt;/a>. You will only need a basic understanding of mathematics, beginner level c++ and a general knowledge of the CryEngine SDK; in particular, the gamesdk.dll code which is written in c++.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>CryEngine 3 System Event Dispatcher</title><link>https://www.hawkes.info/post/cryengine-3-system-event-dispatcher/</link><pubDate>Sat, 15 Mar 2014 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.hawkes.info/post/cryengine-3-system-event-dispatcher/</guid><description>&lt;p>Earlier this week I wrote about CryEngine listener classes in a brief overview.

The developers seemed organised and were well advanced in terms of graphic and environmental production.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>How to Make .PAK Files With Your Assets</title><link>https://www.hawkes.info/post/how-to-make-pak-files-with-your-assets/</link><pubDate>Thu, 25 Jul 2013 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.hawkes.info/post/how-to-make-pak-files-with-your-assets/</guid><description>&lt;p>Something that doesn&amp;rsquo;t seem to receive much coverage is what to do with all your awesome assets once you&amp;rsquo;ve made your game. You&amp;rsquo;re going to need to ship them to end users, and the best way is within a .PAK file.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Building A Cheap Motion Capture Studio</title><link>https://www.hawkes.info/post/building-a-cheap-motion-capture-studio/</link><pubDate>Tue, 16 Jul 2013 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.hawkes.info/post/building-a-cheap-motion-capture-studio/</guid><description>&lt;p>A while back I became interested in motion capture as a means to easily get basic animations into the game I am working on.

I don&amp;rsquo;t actually get a choice about which parts I will try and deal with, but I do get a choice about the order in which it happens.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Creating Interesting Terrain</title><link>https://www.hawkes.info/post/creating-interesting-terrain/</link><pubDate>Sat, 23 Feb 2013 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.hawkes.info/post/creating-interesting-terrain/</guid><description>&lt;p>At first blush terrain might seem like a fairly easy thing to be able to create, and at it&amp;rsquo;s simplest it might well be. Toss a few mountains about, some rolling hills, a valley or two, a little water, and you&amp;rsquo;re done - or are you?&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Overcoming Inertia</title><link>https://www.hawkes.info/post/overcoming-inertia/</link><pubDate>Fri, 18 Jan 2013 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.hawkes.info/post/overcoming-inertia/</guid><description>&lt;p>A few weeks have passed with very little development occurring.

I tried tinkering with the gameplay parameters and added in extra elements and came up with a hybrid that might be interesting when I get back to it. My big mistake though was to create a landmass about 8 times bigger than was really needed. Even using much of it for ocean, I was still left with these way too large spaces for the tight gameplay I wanted.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>CryEngine3 and UDK3</title><link>https://www.hawkes.info/post/cryengine3-and-udk3/</link><pubDate>Sun, 11 Nov 2012 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.hawkes.info/post/cryengine3-and-udk3/</guid><description>&lt;p>I&amp;rsquo;ve been playing games for over 30 years now and I&amp;rsquo;ve seen them progress from simple text based games through all the iterations to give us the amazing looking games we have today. I have at times written my own games; most were very simple - due to the nature of the machines at the time.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
