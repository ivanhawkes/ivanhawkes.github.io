The developers seemed organised and were well advanced in terms of graphic and environmental production.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>How to Make .PAK Files With Your Assets</title><link>https://ivanhawkes.github.io/post/how-to-make-pak-files-with-your-assets/</link><pubDate>Thu, 25 Jul 2013 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://ivanhawkes.github.io/post/how-to-make-pak-files-with-your-assets/</guid><description>&lt;p>Something that doesn&amp;rsquo;t seem to receive much coverage is what to do with all your awesome assets once you&amp;rsquo;ve made your game. You&amp;rsquo;re going to need to ship them to end users, and the best way is within a .PAK file.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Building A Cheap Motion Capture Studio</title><link>https://ivanhawkes.github.io/post/building-a-cheap-motion-capture-studio/</link><pubDate>Tue, 16 Jul 2013 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://ivanhawkes.github.io/post/building-a-cheap-motion-capture-studio/</guid><description>&lt;p>A while back I became interested in motion capture as a means to easily get basic animations into the game I am working on. Using reasonably priced software from &lt;a href="http://www.brekel.com/" title="Brekel Software">Brekel&lt;/a> and a cheap Microsoft &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kinect" title="XBox Kinect">Xbox Kinect&lt;/a> camera you have the beginnings of a motion capture setup.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Dealing With The Difficulty</title><link>https://ivanhawkes.github.io/post/dealing-with-the-difficulty/</link><pubDate>Wed, 10 Apr 2013 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://ivanhawkes.github.io/post/dealing-with-the-difficulty/</guid><description>&lt;p>I&amp;rsquo;ve been working on my pet project for almost five months now and I must admit that some parts of the project are easier than others. I don&amp;rsquo;t actually get a choice about which parts I will try and deal with, but I do get a choice about the order in which it happens.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>On Building a World</title><link>https://ivanhawkes.github.io/post/on-building-a-world/</link><pubDate>Mon, 25 Mar 2013 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://ivanhawkes.github.io/post/on-building-a-world/</guid><description>&lt;p>To date I&amp;rsquo;ve been focusing on making my little zone with little regard for the world around it. Till now it&amp;rsquo;s been acceptable to know just the prime locale of the zone, but it&amp;rsquo;s been niggling at me that I don&amp;rsquo;t know it&amp;rsquo;s location on a world map, it&amp;rsquo;s climate, or even the location of the sun.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Creating Interesting Terrain</title><link>https://ivanhawkes.github.io/post/creating-interesting-terrain/</link><pubDate>Sat, 23 Feb 2013 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://ivanhawkes.github.io/post/creating-interesting-terrain/</guid><description>&lt;p>At first blush terrain might seem like a fairly easy thing to be able to create, and at it&amp;rsquo;s simplest it might well be. Toss a few mountains about, some rolling hills, a valley or two, a little water, and you&amp;rsquo;re done - or are you?&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Sunset Oasis</title><link>https://ivanhawkes.github.io/post/sunset-oasis/</link><pubDate>Mon, 26 Nov 2012 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://ivanhawkes.github.io/post/sunset-oasis/</guid><description>&lt;p>My first effort towards building a CTF style game went a little awry. I tried tinkering with the gameplay parameters and added in extra elements and came up with a hybrid that might be interesting when I get back to it. My big mistake though was to create a landmass about 8 times bigger than was really needed. Even using much of it for ocean, I was still left with these way too large spaces for the tight gameplay I wanted.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>CryEngine3 and UDK3</title><link>https://ivanhawkes.github.io/post/cryengine3-and-udk3/</link><pubDate>Sun, 11 Nov 2012 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://ivanhawkes.github.io/post/cryengine3-and-udk3/</guid><description>&lt;p>I&amp;rsquo;ve been playing games for over 30 years now and I&amp;rsquo;ve seen them progress from simple text based games through all the iterations to give us the amazing looking games we have today. I have at times written my own games; most were very simple - due to the nature of the machines at the time.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
