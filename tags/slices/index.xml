It keeps well in the cupboard or fridge.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In our family, this was always known as fudgecake. It&amp;rsquo;s a recipe mum would make a few times a year as a treat for the family. It requires few ingredients, and no cooking.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Conveniently, each of the major ingredients can be bought at local supermarkets in those sizes.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
