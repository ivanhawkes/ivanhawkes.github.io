I tried tinkering with the gameplay parameters and added in extra elements and came up with a hybrid that might be interesting when I get back to it. My big mistake though was to create a landmass about 8 times bigger than was really needed. Even using much of it for ocean, I was still left with these way too large spaces for the tight gameplay I wanted.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>CryEngine3 and UDK3</title><link>https://ivanhawkes.github.io/post/cryengine3-and-udk3/</link><pubDate>Sun, 11 Nov 2012 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://ivanhawkes.github.io/post/cryengine3-and-udk3/</guid><description>&lt;p>I&amp;rsquo;ve been playing games for over 30 years now and I&amp;rsquo;ve seen them progress from simple text based games through all the iterations to give us the amazing looking games we have today.
